# [Lux AI] Working Title Bot
The code structure and logic, as well as hints for improvements will be elaborated in the comment section.

I hope this can be a useful template for you to work on your bot on.
You are strongly recommended to edit on a clone/fork of [my repository](https://github.com/tonghuikang/lux-ai-2021) with your favorite IDE.
You can submit the zip the repository to the competition. This notebook is generated with `generate_notebook.py`.

Regardless, do feel free to clone this notebook and submit `submission.tar.gz`.
